I am a PhD candidate in AI at Seoul National University, advised by Professor [Gunhee Kim](). I received my BS in Computer Science from Columbia University and a BA in Mathematics from Bard College.

My research focuses on multimodal AI, with a particular emphasis on bias-driven multimodal hallucinations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). I explore how these hallucinations can both emerge from and amplify biases in the underlying components of these models. My goal is to develop a deeper understanding of these biases and their impact on model reliability, while also exploring ways to mitigate them for safer, more robust AI systems.
