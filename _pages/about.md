Hello! I am a PhD candidate in AI at Seoul National University, advised by Professor [Gunhee Kim](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/gunhee/). I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Columbia University and a B.A. in Mathematics from Bard College.

My research focuses on multimodal AI, with an emphasis on bias-driven multimodal hallucinations in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). I explore how these hallucinations can both emerge from and amplify biases in the underlying components of these models. My goal is to develop a deeper understanding of these biases and their impact on model reliability, while also exploring ways to mitigate them for safer, more robust AI systems.
